\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The fact that \clos{} is defined as a \clos{} program introduces two
categories of issues that must be addressed, namely
\emph{bootstrapping issues} and \emph{metastability issues}
\cite{Kiczales:1991:AMP:574212}.  Of the two, the latter is the more
difficult one, and also the one that has the most negative impact on
the \emph{elegance} of the code in that it requires base cases to be
handled specially.

We describe \emph{satiation}, a technique by which metastability
issues can be turned into bootstrapping issues, thereby simplifying
them and keeping the code elegant.  Satiation consists of pre-loading
the call history of a generic function with respect to a set of
argument classes so that the base cases are handled without invoking
the full protocol for computing the effective methods at runtime.
