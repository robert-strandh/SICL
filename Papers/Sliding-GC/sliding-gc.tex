\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Garbage collection algorithms are divided into three main categories,
namely \emph{mark-and-sweep}, \emph{mark-and-compact}, and
\emph{copying} collectors.  The collectors in the
\emph{mark-and-compact} category are frequently overlooked, perhaps
because they have traditionally been associated with greater cost than
collectors in the other categories.  Among the compacting collectors,
the \emph{sliding} collector has some advantages in that it preserves
the \emph{relative age} of objects.  The main problem with the
traditional sliding collector by Haddon and Waite \cite{Haddon:1967}
is that building address-forwarding tables is costly.  We suggest an
improvement to the existing algorithm that reverses the order between
building the forwarding table and moving the objects.  Our method
improves performance of building the table, making the sliding
collector a better contestant for young generations of objects
(nurseries).
