\section{Conclusions and future work}

We have presented an improvement to the compacting and sliding
collector invented by Haddon and Waite \cite{Haddon:1967}.  Our method
is an improvement in that it does not require the partially built
break table to be moved, because the entire table is built
\emph{after} the compaction phase is finished.

While it is extremely difficult to compare performance of different
methods for garbage collection, in order to get an indication of the
performance of our method, we created a number of tests.  We believe
these tests show that the method we suggest is not prohibitively
expensive.  The advantages of compaction to overall performance of the
garbage collector are hard to measure or even estimate, but we think
that they will compensate for the slight increase in cost of
compaction compared to ordinary copying or mark-and-sweep.

We plan to use this algorithm in the per-thread nursery collector in
our system \sicl{}.%

Inspired by the Multics system, we plan to
instrument the system with a number of \emph{meters} so that
performance data can be collected at all times.  Only then will we be
able to obtain a final verdict concerning the performance of this
method.
