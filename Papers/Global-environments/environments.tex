\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\emph{Environments} are mentioned in many places in
the \commonlisp{} standard, but the nature of such objects is not
specified.  For the purpose of this paper, an environment is a mapping
from \emph{names} to \emph{meanings}.  In a typical \commonlisp{}
implementation the \emph{global environment} is not a first-class
object.

In this paper, we advocate first-class global environments,
not as an extension or a modification of the \commonlisp{} standard,
but as an implementation technique.  We state several advantages in
terms of bootstrapping, sandboxing, and more.  We show an
implementation where there is no performance penalty associated with
making the environment first class.  For performance purposes, the
essence of the implementation relies on the environment containing
\emph{cells} (ordinary \texttt{cons} cells in our implementation)
holding bindings of names to functions and global values that are
likely to be heavily solicited at runtime.
