\section{Introduction}

The \commonlisp{} \cite{ansi:common:lisp} sequence functions are
challenging to implement for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\item They take several keyword parameters that modify the behavior in
  different ways.  Several special cases must therefore be taken into
  account according to the value of these keyword parameters.
\item In order for performance to be acceptable, different variations
  may have to be implemented according to the type of the sequence to
  be traversed.
\item When the sequence is a vector, it may be necessary to specialize
  the implementation according to the element type of the vector, and
  according to whether the vector is a \emph{simple array} or not.
\end{itemize}
