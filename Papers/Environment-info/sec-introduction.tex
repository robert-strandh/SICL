\section{Introduction}

The \commonlisp{} standard contains many references to environments.
Most of these references concern \emph{lexical} environments at
\emph{compile time}, because they are needed in order to process forms
in non-null lexical environments.  The standard does not specify the
nature of these objects, though in CLtL2 \cite{Steele:1990:CLL:95411}
there is a suggested protocol that is sometimes supplied in existing
\commonlisp{} implementations.
