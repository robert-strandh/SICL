\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The concept of an \emph{environment} is mentioned in many places in
the \commonlisp{} standard, but the nature of the object is not
specified.  For the purpose of this paper, an environment is a mapping
from \emph{names} to \emph{meanings}.

In this paper, we propose a replacement for the protocol documented in
the book Common Lisp the Language, second edition.  Rather than using
multiple values as that protocol does, the protocol suggested in this
paper returns class instances.  Accessor functions on those supply the
information that the compiler needs. 

The advantage of this approach is that it is easier to extend than the
previous protocol, so that implementations can suggest additional
functionality on these objects.  Furthermore, CLOS dispatch can be
used on these objects, thus enabling object-oriented techniques.
