# SICL: A new Common Lisp Implementation

This is the main source code repository for SICL. It contains the compiler,
standard library, and documentation.

# What is SICL?
SICL is a new implementation of Common
Lisp. It is intentionally
divided into many implementation-independent modules that are written
in a totally or near-totally portable way, so as to allow other
implementations to incorporate these modules from SICL, rather than
having to maintain their own, perhaps implementation-specific
versions. 


## Quick Start
