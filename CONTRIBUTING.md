# Contributing to SICL

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SICL! There are many ways to
contribute, and we appreciate all of them.
If you want to contribute to SICL, you would either start working on a
new module, or improve an existing one.  Most of the existing modules
have a status.txt file that describes what exists and what needs to
be done, how to run the tests etc.  If you want to start a new module,
it is best to copy the structures of existing modules.
