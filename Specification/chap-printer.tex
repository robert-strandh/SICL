\chapter{Printer}

The printer module, named \incless{} has been extracted to a separate
repository%
\footnote{https://github.com/s-expressionists/Incless}.
It currently provides definitions of standard functions such as
\texttt{print}, \texttt{princ}, \texttt{print-object}, etc.  It does
not directly provide methods on \texttt{print-object} for different
classes of objects, because we want it to be possible for client code
to customize this behavior.  Instead, the default method on
\texttt{print-object} trampolines to a generic function named
\texttt{print-object-using-client} which has an additional
\emph{client} parameter.

The \texttt{format} function is nearly complete, and will be
incorporated into \incless{} in the near future.  The directory
\texttt{Code/Format} contains a near-complete What is missing is the
implementation of the \texttt{formatter} function.

We use the method created by Adams
\cite{Adams:2018:RFF:3296979.3192369} for printing floating-point
numbers.
