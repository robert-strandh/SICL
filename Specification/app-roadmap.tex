\subsection{Clostrophilia}

We introduced symbols such as x+1, x-1, and x\^\ to indicate different
``refinement'', but we can eliminate those if we use the new renaming
feature in the bootstrapping procedure.  That way, the Clostrophilia
code looks more ``natural''.  We do need to verify that no two systems
contain both symbol x and one of the variants simultaneously.  We can
then eliminate comments about refinement.

The documentation is embryonic and needs to be improved.

\section{Bootstrapping}

\subsection{Replace cell sharing by renaming}

We used to use the macro \texttt{with-intercepted-function-cells} to
share cells between environments.  We may still need this macro in
order to introduce cells containing host functions, but for other
usages, we now have a better macro
\texttt{with-intercepted-function-names} that make it much more
obvious what functions call functions in other environments.  We
should apply this new macro to various Clostrophilia subsystems to
avoid funny symbol names.
