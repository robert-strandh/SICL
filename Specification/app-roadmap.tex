\chapter{Roadmap}

\section{External libraries}

\subsection{Clostrophilia}

We introduced symbols such as x+1, x-1, and x\^\ to indicate different
``refinement'', but we can eliminate those if we use the new renaming
feature in the bootstrapping procedure.  That way, the Clostrophilia
code looks more ``natural''.  We do need to verify that no two systems
contain both symbol x and one of the variants simultaneously.  We can
then eliminate comments about refinement.

The documentation is embryonic and needs to be improved.

\subsection{Common macros}

Currently, the repository ``Common-macros'' contains two systems,
namely \texttt{common-macros} and \texttt{common-macro-definitions}.
We intended for \texttt{common-macros} to contain standard macros in
the form of AST transformations, but this turned out to be harder than
we had expected, simply because the code for such a transformation
because very ugly.  So we created the system
\texttt{common-macro-definitions} to contain standard macros in the
traditional way, using DEFMACRO forms.  Only
\texttt{common-macro-definitions} is currently used, and
\texttt{common-macros} is incomplete.

We want to remove the system \texttt{common-macros} from this
repository, rename it, and put it in a separate repository, say
\texttt{common-ast-macro-transformations} or something like that.  We
would have liked to rename \texttt{common-macro-definitions} to
\texttt{common-macros}, but it is already used by others, and we don't
want to force them to change their code.

\section{Bootstrapping}

\subsection{Replace cell sharing by renaming}

We used to use the macro \texttt{with-intercepted-function-cells} to
share cells between environments.  We may still need this macro in
order to introduce cells containing host functions, but for other
usages, we now have a better macro
\texttt{with-intercepted-function-names} that make it much more
obvious what functions call functions in other environments.  We
should apply this new macro to various Clostrophilia subsystems to
avoid funny symbol names.

\subsection{Maybe use more than one final environment}

The current idea is to make environment number 4 the ``final''
environment to be used as a model for the one in the final system.
But we have already suggested the use of several environments in the
final system, like a separate environment for each nontrivial
subsystem, like the compiler.  But there might already be some such
nontrivial subsystems that could be put in separate environments.  For
that to be a useful thing to do, the subsystem should contain a
significant amount of code, but supply very few entry points for
general use, like the compiler with \texttt{compile},
\texttt{compile-file}, and \texttt{eval}.  One such existing system
would be \texttt{ctype} that supplies only \texttt{typep} and
\texttt{subtypep}.
