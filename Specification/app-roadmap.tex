\subsection{Clostrophilia}

We introduced symbols such as x+1, x-1, and x\^\ to indicate different
``refinement'', but we can eliminate those if we use the new renaming
feature in the bootstrapping procedure.  That way, the Clostrophilia
code looks more ``natural''.  We do need to verify that no two systems
contain both symbol x and one of the variants simultaneously.
