\chapter{Removed systems}

This appendix contains a list of systems that were removed for one of
several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\item The code used to work, but is no longer working due to updates
  in code that it depends on.  More work is needed for it to be usable
  again.
\item The code never worked, and it needs more work in order for it to
  be considered part of \sysname{}.
\item The code never worked, and we have no ambition to make it work,
  but it nevertheless contains interesting ideas that we might revive
  in the future.
\end{itemize}
