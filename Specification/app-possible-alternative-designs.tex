\section{Representation of standard objects}

Currently, standard objects are represented by a two-word header and a
rack.  The header contains a pointer to the class object, and a
pointer to the rack.  The problem with this representation is that a
two-word CAS (Compare-And-Swap) instruction is required to avoid locks
and data races when an object is supplied to \texttt{change-class}.

The suggested alternative design is to put the class pointer in the
rack rather than in the header.  Then, \texttt{change-class} would
created a complete new rack, including a pointer to the new class, and
a single-word CAS instruction could be used to update the object.

With this representation, a word is freed up in the header.  The
garbage collector depends on the header being two words, so it would
seem that the freed-up word would then be wasted.  We suggest putting
the hash value for the object in the header, as this value can be
linked to the identity of the object.
