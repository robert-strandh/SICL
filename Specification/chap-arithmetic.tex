\chapter{Arithmetic}

The code for arithmetic functions is contained in the directory
\texttt{Code/Arithmetic}.  At the moment, this code is very
preliminary.  There is not even a package definition for the package
used in the file \texttt{arithemtic.lisp}.

The code contains definitions of the functions \texttt{+}, \texttt{-},
\texttt{*}, and \texttt{/}.  These functions call binary versions also
defined in the same file.  There are also compiler macros to turn
calls to these functions with a known number of arguments into calls
to the binary versions.

The binary versions of the arithmetic functions dispatch according to
the exact type of the arguments to binary versions of the function
with a specific combination of types, but those specific functions
have not yet been written.  Some of those functions can be written
using portable code, but most of them will probably use
machine-specific low-level instructions. 

We have no specific advice for anyone who might be interested in
working on code for arithmetic functions.
