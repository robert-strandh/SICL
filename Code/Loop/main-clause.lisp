(cl:in-package #:sicl-loop)

;;; In the dictionary entry for LOOP, the HyperSpec says:
;;;
;;;   main-clause ::= unconditional | 
;;;                   accumulation |
;;;                   conditional |
;;;                   termination-test |
;;;                   initial-final
;;;
;;; Here, we exclude initial-final.  The reason for that is that
;;; initial-final is also one of the possibilities for a
;;; variable-clause, and the reason for this "multiple inheritance" is
;;; so that the LOOP macro syntax can be defined to have the syntax:
;;;
;;;   loop [name-clause] {variable-clause}* {main-clause}*
;;;
;;; which then allows for INITIALLY and FINALLY clauses to occur
;;; anywhere after the name-clause.
;;;
;;; What we do here is to treat INITIALLY and FINALLY specially, so
;;; that they are neither main clauses nor variable clauses.
;;; Therefore, here, we have:
;;;
;;;   main-clause ::= unconditional | 
;;;                   accumulation |
;;;                   conditional |
;;;                   termination-test
;;;
;;; Furthermore, the HyperSpec defines selectable-clause like this:
;;;
;;;   selectable-clause ::= unconditional | accumulation | conditional 
;;;
;;; so we can say:
;;;
;;;    main-clause ::= selectable-clause | termination-test
