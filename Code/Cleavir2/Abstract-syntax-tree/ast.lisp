(cl:in-package #:cleavir-ast)

;;;; We define the abstract syntax trees (ASTs) that represent not
;;;; only Common Lisp code, but also the low-level operations that we
;;;; use to implement the Common Lisp operators that can not be
;;;; portably implemented using other Common Lisp operators.
;;;; 
;;;; The AST is a very close representation of the source code, except
;;;; that the environment is no longer present, so that there are no
;;;; longer any different namespaces for functions and variables.  And
;;;; of course, operations such as MACROLET are not present because
;;;; they only alter the environment.  
;;;;
;;;; The AST form is the preferred representation for some operations;
;;;; in particular for PROCEDURE INTEGRATION (sometimes called
;;;; INLINING).
