(cl:in-package #:sicl-simple-environment)

;;;; This file contains definitions of classes, functions, and
;;;; variables for creating and manipulating global environments.  It
;;;; contains no definitions involving symbols in the COMMON-LISP
;;;; package.  Such definitions are located in separate files. 

;;;; An environment contains ENTRIES of various kinds.  An entry can
;;;; be a BASE ENTRY.  This is the kind of entry used for variables,
;;;; functions, and macros, but also for autonomous declarations such
;;;; as OPTIMIZE.  Other entries are AUXILIARY entries, in that they
;;;; provide additional information about other entries.  This type of
;;;; entry is used for declarations of type, inline, and dynamic
;;;; extent, but a compiler-macro entry is also an auxiliary entry.
;;;;
;;;; When the information about some entity is wanted at some point in
;;;; the compilation process, the current environment is first
;;;; searched for a BASE ENTRY.  Then, it is searched again for
;;;; auxiliary entries that provide additional information about the
;;;; particular base entry that was found.  All this information is
;;;; then combined into an object called an INFO object which is
;;;; finally returned.

;;; Global environment.
;;;
;;; The global environment is divided into namespaces, but a namespace
;;; may be represented in several different slots.  So for instance,
;;; what is usually considered the FUNCTION namespace, we have divided
;;; into four separate lists, consisting of global function entries,
;;; global macro entries, special operator entries and compiler-macro
;;; entries.  Likewise, what is usually considered the VARIABLE
;;; namespace, we have divided into three separate lists, consisting
;;; of special variable entries, constant variable entries and global
;;; symbol macro entries.
