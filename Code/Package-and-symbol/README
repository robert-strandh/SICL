There is a lot to be done in this directory:

 * It needs a file called documentation-strings-english.lisp in which
   there should be documentation strings for the functions and classes
   defined in this module.  It should be modeled after
   Cons-high/docstrings-en.lisp

 * There are several FIXME comments in functions.lisp.  They should be
   taken care of accordingly.

 * Calls to ERROR should not have string arguments.  They should have
   the name of conditions defined in the file conditions.lisp.

 * Calls to ERROR should have restarts whenever there is a reasonable
   action to take in such a restart.  For example the error that
   signals NOT-A-PACKAGE-DESIGNATOR should have a restart for
   supplying a valid package designator.

 * Calls to ASSERT should be replaced by calls to ERROR with specific
   signals and they should also have associated restarts whenever
   reasonable.
