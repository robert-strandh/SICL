\section{Introduction}

Compiling a \cl{} program is done in constant interaction with an
\emph{environment}.  The \hs{} stipulates%
\footnote{See Section 3.2.1 of the \hs{}.}
that there are four different environments that are relevant to
compilation:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{startup environment}.  This environment is the global
  environment of the \cl{} system when the compiler was invoked.
\item The \emph{compilation environment}.  This environment is the
  local environment in which forms are compiled.  It is also the
  environment that is passed to macro expanders.
\item The \emph{evaluation environment}.  According to the \hs{}, this
  environment is ``a run-time environment in which macro expanders and
  code specified by \texttt{eval-when} to be evaluated are
  evaluated''. 
\item The \emph{run-time environment}.  This environment is used when
  the resulting compiled program is executed.
\end{itemize}

The \hs{} does not specify how environments are represented, and there
is no specified protocol for manipulating environments.  As a result,
each implementation has its own representation and its own protocols. 

In this chapter, we define a protocol for accessing the compilation
environment during compilation.  When \sysname{} is asked to convert a
form to an abstract syntax tree, client code must supply an object
that represents the startup environment.  During the conversion
process, \sysname{} will call the functions documented in
\refSec{sec-environment-augmenting} to augment the startup environment
with information introduced by binding forms to form an augmented
compilation environment.  To determine the meaning of the program
elements in the form to be converted, \sysname{} will call the
functions documented in \refSec{sec-environment-querying}.  

Client code must supply methods on the functions in
\refSec{sec-environment-augmenting} to augment the environment and
return the resulting environment.  Client code must also supply
methods on the functions in \refSec{sec-environment-querying} that
will query the environment (whether the startup environment or the
augmented environment) and return the relevant information to
\sysname{}. 

It might seem that \sysname{} could represent the \emph{local part} of
the environment (i.e., the part of the environment that is temporarily
introduced when nested forms are compiled) in whatever way it pleases,
but this is not the case.  The reason is that the full environment
must be passed as an argument to macro expanders that are defined in
the startup environment, and those macro expanders are implementation
specific.  It is also not possible for \sysname{} to define its own
version of \texttt{macroexpand}, because a globally defined
implementation-specific macro expander may call the
implementation-specific version of \texttt{macroexpand} which would
fail if given an environment other than the one defined by the
implementation. 

\sysname{} does, however, provide some features that are useful for an
incomplete implementation for which no representation of the local
part of the environment has been determined.  The creator of such an
implementation may choose to use the \emph{default representation} of
that local part of the environment supplied by \sysname{}.  The
default version can also be used for a more complete implementations,
provided that the implementation-specific version of
\texttt{macroexpand} is not called on an environment using this
default representation.

\section{Package}
\label{sec-environment-package}

All symbols documented in this chapter have as their home package the
package named \texttt{cleavir-environment}.  This package has a single
nickname which is \texttt{cleavir-env}.  We strongly advise against
\texttt{:use}-ing this package, because it contains several symbols
that have the same name as symbols in the package named
\texttt{common-lisp}.  Instead, we advise that client code use symbols
in this package with their explicit package prefix.

\section{Querying the environment}
\label{sec-environment-querying}

In this section, we describe classes and functions that are used by
the compiler to query the environment concerning information about
program elements that the compiler needs in order to determine how to
process those program elements. 

When the compiler calls a generic query function, it passes the
environment as the first argument.  Client code must supply methods
on these functions, specialized to its particular representation of
environments. 

These methods should return instances of the classes described in this
section.  Any such instance contains all available information about
some program element in that particular environment.  This information
must typically be assembled from different parts of the environment.
For that reason, client code typically creates a new instance whenever
a query function is called, rather than attempting to store such
instances in the environment.  If any of these client-supplied methods
fails to accomplish its task, it should return \texttt{nil}.

Client code is free to define subclasses of the classes described
here, for instance in order to represent implementation-specific
information about the program elements.  Client code would then
typically also provide auxiliary methods or overriding primary methods
on the compilation functions that handle these classes.

information about a variable.  The compiler has already verified that
there is a lexical variable or a special variable named
\textit{symbol} in scope in \textit{environment}.  The value of the
\textit{ignore} parameter is either the symbol \texttt{ignore} or the
symbol \texttt{ignorable}.  The function returns a new environment
augmented with the new information.  The original environment is not
affected.

\Defgeneric {add-function-ignore} {environment function-name ignore}

This generic function is called by the compiler in order to add ignore
information about a function.  The compiler has already verified that
there is a local function or a global function named
\textit{functionname} in scope in \textit{environment}.  The value of
the \textit{ignore} parameter is either the symbol \texttt{ignore} or
the symbol \texttt{ignorable}.  The function returns a new environment
augmented with the new information.  The original environment is not
affected.

\subsection{Adding dynamic-extent information}

\Defgeneric {add-variable-dynamic-extent} {environment symbol}

verified that there is a local function named \textit{functionname} in
scope in \textit{environment}.  The function returns a new environment
augmented with the new information.  The original environment is not
affected.

\subsection{Adding optimize information}

\Defgeneric {add-optimize} {environment quality value}

This generic function is called by the compiler in order to add
optimize information to the environment.  The value of the
\textit{quality} parameter is one of the symbols \texttt{speed},
\texttt{compilation-speed}, \texttt{debug}, \texttt{safety}, and
\texttt{space}.  The value of the \textit{value} parameter is an
integer between $0$ and $3$ inclusive.  The function returns a new
environment augmented with the new information.  The original
environment is not affected.

\subsection{Adding inline information}

\Defgeneric {add-inline} {environment function-name inline}

This generic function is called by the compiler in order to add inline
information about a function.  The compiler has already verified that
there is a local function or a global function named
\textit{functionname} in scope in \textit{environment}.  The value of
the \textit{inline} parameter is either the symbol \texttt{inline} or
the symbol \texttt{notinline}.  The function returns a new environment
augmented with the new information.  The original environment is not
