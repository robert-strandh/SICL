;;;
;;; Compute nodes where a PHI functions should be inserted for a
;;; single variable V.
;;;
;;; This function takes the following arguments:
;;;
;;;   * DOMINANCE-FRONTIERS.  The dominance frontiers of every node as
;;;     computed by the function CLEAVIR-DOMINANCE:DOMINANCE-FRONTIERS.
;;;
;;;   * LIVE-P. A function of one argument that takes a node and
;;;     returns true if and only if V is live at that node.  Client
;;;     code can pass (CONSTANTLY T) as an argument, in which case the
;;;     ordinary (not pruned) SSA form will be computed.
;;;
;;;   * NODES.  A set of nodes where V is being defined (i.e., its
;;;     value is modified)
;;;
;;; This function returns a set (represented as a list) of nodes
;;; corresponding to the join points where phi functions should be
;;; inserted for V.
;;;
;;; The algorithm used is an adaptation of the algorithm in the 1991
;;; paper by Cytron et al, "Efficiently Computing Static Single
;;; Assignment Form and the Control Dependence Graph".  Their flags
;;; named Work is what is named PROCESSED-P in our algorithm.  We have
;;; no equivalent of their flags HasAlready; instead we just test
;;; whether the node is already a member of RESULT.  Our solution
;;; might have some extra cost associated with it if the number of PHI
;;; nodes for some variable should turn out to be very large.  Should
;;; that be the case, we might consider adding a second hash table
;;; with the same contents as RESULT.
;;;
;;; We include a modification of this algorithm as defined in in paper
;;; by Choi, Cytron and Ferranti, "Automatic Construction of Sparse
;;; Data Flow Evaluation Graphs" where nodes are included only if V is
;;; live there.

;;;
;;; Compute PHI instructions for a single variable V.
;;;
;;; The algorithm is an adaptation of the algorithm in the 1991 paper
;;; by Cytron et al, "Efficiently Computing Static Single Assignment
;;; Form and the Control Dependence Graph".
;;;
;;; First of all, in this algorithm, we are using individual
;;; instructions rather than basic blocks.  Therefore, what is a loop
;;; over all "statements" in the paper is no longer a loop here.
;;;
;;; Second, this algorithm is valid for a single variable.  For that
;;; reason, we do not have a stack for each variable.
;;;
;;; Third, what is an explicit stack for each variable in the paper is
;;; a stack handled by the call stack as an argument here.  For that
;;; reason, we no not need explicit pops.
;;;
;;; Fourth, the paper pushes the variable each time the variable is
;;; encountered on a left hand side.  Then as many pops are executed
;;; afterwards.  These pushes and pops are not needed, because the
;;; intermediate variables are never at the top of the stack.  But
;;; since we have a basic block per instruction, we actually DO
;;; (implicitly) push all those intermediate variables. 
;;;
;;; TOP-NODE is the topmost (in the dominance tree) node in which the
;;; variable is mentioned (and therefore assigned to).  PHI-NODES are
;;; the nodes returned by the function PHI-FUNCTION-NODES above.
;;; ORIGINAL-VARIABLE is the variable to be processed.  LIVE-P is a
;;; function that takes a node and returns true if and only if the
;;; variable is live in that node.  DOMINEES is a function that takes
;;; a node N and returns a list of nodes that are immediately
;;; dominated by N.
