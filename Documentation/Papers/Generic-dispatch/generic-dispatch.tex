\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We describe a technique for generic dispatch that is adapted to modern
computers where accessing memory is potentially quite expensive.
Instead of the traditional hashing scheme used by PCL
\cite{Kiczales:1990:EMD:91556.91600}, we assign a \emph{unique number}
to each class, and the dispatch consists of comparisons of the number
assigned to an instance with a certain number of (usually small)
constant integers.  While our implementation (SICL) is not yet in a
state where we are able to get exact performance figures, a
conservative simulation suggests that our technique is significantly
faster than the one used in SBCL, which uses PCL, and indeed faster
than the technique used by most high-performance \cl{}
implementations.  Furthermore, existing work
\cite{Zendra:1997:EDD:263698.263728} using a similar technique in the
context of static languages suggests that perfomance can improve
significantly compared to table-based techniques.
