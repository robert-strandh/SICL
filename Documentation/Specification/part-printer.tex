\chapter{Printer}

A large part of the printer can be written portably without
performance penalty.  We intend to supply standard methods for
\texttt{print-object}, and code for functions such as \texttt{princ},
\texttt{prin1}, and \texttt{print}. 

We are planning to use the method created by Burger and Dybvig to
print floating-point numbers so that they can be read back to the
exact same number.
