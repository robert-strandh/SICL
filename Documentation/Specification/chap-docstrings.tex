\chapter{Documentation strings for all Common Lisp symbols}

As mentioned elsewhere, we believe that documentation strings should
be separate from code, because they do not address the same audience.
In addition, separating the two allows us to distribute the
documentation strings as a separate module.  Many implementations have
substandard documentation strings, so this is an important module that
can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing ones.

We will provide the infrastructure for allowing internationalization
of documentation strings, but we probably will not provide different
versions for different languages.
