\chapter{Pretty printer}

Richard C Waters designed the pretty printer for
\commonlisp{} (\cite{Waters89xp:a}, \cite{Waters:1992:UNC:1039991.1039996}).
It may be possible to use it directly for \sysname{}.  Certainly, the
existence of XP (i.e. what Waters designed) makes it low priority for
\sysname{} to have its own. 

As I recall, there are some minor differences between XP and what was
ultimately incorporated in the standard, but a long time has passed
since I looked at it.

I also do not recall the license according to which XP is distributed.
It may or may not be compatible with that of \sysname{}.  Finally, it
may be that XP does not conform to the \sysname{} coding standards.
